# Task Startup Protocol

Use this protocol immediately after a task is created or reassigned. The goal is to confirm readiness before coding begins.

## 1. Review task metadata
- Read the title, description, and acceptance criteria.
- Check phase, priority, and linked resources.

## 2. Establish context
- Gather relevant docs (CLAUDE.md excerpts, previous tasks, design specs).
- Load project memory or Context7 materials if the task requires research.

## 3. Define the approach
- Outline planned steps or draft an implementation plan.
- Identify risks, blockers, or required approvals.

## 4. Confirm environment
- Ensure local dev setup matches project requirements.
- Verify database migrations, feature flags, or services needed for the work.

## 5. Communicate the plan
- Summarize the intended approach to stakeholders.
- Capture expected deliverables, test coverage, and review strategy.

Only start implementation after the plan is validated and all prerequisites are in place.***
