# Task Completion Protocol

Follow this checklist before marking any task as complete. It ensures deliverables, documentation, and quality gates are satisfied.

## 1. Verify implementation
- Confirm every acceptance criterion in the description has been met.
- Ensure code changes are committed and traceable to the task.

## 2. Validate quality
- Run required automated tests (unit, integration, linting).
- Capture evidence (logs, screenshots, coverage summaries) for review.

## 3. Update documentation
- Record architectural notes, migration steps, or follow-up work.
- Update READMEs, changelogs, or protocol logs as needed.

## 4. Prepare the handoff
- Summarize changes, testing performed, and residual risks.
- Highlight any outstanding issues or TODOs for future tracking.

## 5. Close the loop
- Mark the task `completed` in DevStream, including completion notes.
- Notify stakeholders and link the summary in the project history.

If any checklist item is incomplete, treat the task as `blocked` or `in review` instead of closing it.***
